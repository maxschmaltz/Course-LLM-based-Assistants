In the first part (12.11), we'll preprocess our data for further retrieval. Next day (13.11), we will complete the RAG chatbot and use the data we have preprocessed in the first part to inject our custom knowledge to the LLM. \n",

Youare not obliged to read anything. However, you are strongly encouraged to read references marked bypin emojis \\n: those are comprehensive overviews on the topics or important works that are beneficialfor a better understanding of the key concepts. For the pinned papers, I also specify the pages span foryou to focus on the most important fragments. Some of the sources are also marked with a popcornemoji \\n: that is misc material you might want to take a look at: blog posts, GitHub repos, leaderboardsetc. (also a couple of LLM-based games). For each of the sources, I also leave my subjectiveestimation of how important this work is for this specific topic: from yellow \\n ‘partially useful’ thoughorange \\n ‘useful’ to red \\n ‘crucial findings / thoughts’.  T h e s e  e s t i m a t i o n s  w i l l  b e  c o n t i n u o u s l yupdated as I revise the materials.\\nFor the labs, you are provided with practical tutorials that respective lab tasks will mostly derive from.The core tutorials are marked with a writing emoji \\n; you are asked to inspect them in advance(better yet: try them out). On lab sessions, we will only briefly recap them so it is up to you to preparein advance to keep up with the lab.\\nDisclaimer: the reading entries are no proper citations; the bibtex references as well as detailed infosabout the authors, publish date etc. can be found under the entry links.\\nBlock 1: IntroWeek 122.04. Lecture: LLMs as a Form of Intelligence vs LLMs as Statistical MachinesThat is an introductory lecture, in which I will briefly introduce the course and we’ll have a warming updiscussion about different perspectives on LLMs’ nature. We will focus on two prominent outlooks: LLMis a form of intelligence and LLM is a complex statistical machine. We’ll discuss differences of LLMswith human intelligence and the degree to which LLMs exhibit (self-)awareness.\\nKey points:\\nCourse introduction\\nDifferent perspectives on the nature of LLMs\\nSimilarities and differences between human and artificial intelligence\\nLLMs’ (self-)awareness\\nCore Reading:\\n The Debate Over Understanding in AI’s Large Language Models (pages 1-7), Santa Fe\\nInstitute \\nMeaning without reference in large language models, UC Berkeley & DeepMind \\nDissociating language and thought in large language models (intro [right after the abstract, seemore on the sectioning in this paper at the bottom of page 2], sections 1, 2.3 [LLMs are predictive…], 3-5), The University of Texas at Austin et al. \\nAdditional Reading:\\nLLM-basedAssistants\\nINFOS AND STUFF\\nBLOCK 1: INTRO\\nBLOCK 2: CORE TOPICS | PART 1:BUSINESS APPLICATIONS\\nBLOCK 2: CORE TOPICS | PART 2:APPLICATIONS IN SCIENCE\\nBLOCK 3: WRAP-UP\\nTopics Overview\\nDebates\\nPitches\\nLLM Inference Guide\\n22.04.

    "### Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "During RAG, relevant documents are usually retrieved by semantic similarity that is calculated between the search query and each document in the index. However, if we calculate vectors for the entire PDF pages, we risk not to capture any meaning in the embedding because the context is just too long. That is why usually, loaded text is _chunked_ in a RAG application; embeddings for smaller pieces of text are more discriminative, and thus the relevant context may be retrieved more reliably. Furthermore, it ensure process consistency when working documents of varying sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different approaches to chunking are described in tutorial [Text splitters](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/index#text-splitters) from LangChain. Even though Docling returned a MD document, we won't be using the dedicated [`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/markdown_header_metadata_splitter); instead, for a more general picture, we choose the [`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/recursive_text_splitter) -- a good option in terms of simplicity-quality ratio for simple cases. This splitter tries to keep text structures (paragraphs, sentences) together and thus maintain text coherence in chunks."

To update the state, the function should return a `dict` with the keys corresponding to the state keys, with the **updated** values.

      "1. **Definition and Purpose**: RAG is a technique used in large language models to retrieve specific information from a given knowledge base and use it in its responses.\n",
      "2. **Requirements**: For the pitch on June 17th, a custom RAG chatbot needs to be prepared, which can retrieve specific information from given documents (not from general knowledge) and use it in its responses. Specific requirements will be released on May 22nd.\n",
      "3. **Reading Materials**: There are several reading materials available on RAG, including:\n",
      "\t* \"Retrieval Augmented Generation or Long-Context LLMs? A Comprehensive Study and Hybrid Approach\" by Google DeepMind & University of Michigan (pages 1-7)\n",
      "\t* \"A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language Models\" by York University (sections 1-7)\n",
      "\t* \"Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks\" by National Chengchi University & Academia Sinica\n",
      "4. **Types of RAG**: There are different types of RAG, including:\n",
      "\t* Agentic RAG\n",
      "\t* Adaptive RAG\n",
      "\t* Auto-RAG\n",
      "\t* Self-RAG\n",
      "5. **Tools and Resources**: LangChain provides various tools and resources for RAG, including text splitters, embedding models, vector stores, retrievers, and prompt templates.\n",
      "6. **Lecture and Pitch**: There will be a lecture on May 13th about Virtual Assistants Pt. 2: RAG, which will expand the scope of chatbot functionality and teach it to refer to a custom knowledge base. The pitch on June 17th will be dedicated to a custom RAG chatbot.\n",

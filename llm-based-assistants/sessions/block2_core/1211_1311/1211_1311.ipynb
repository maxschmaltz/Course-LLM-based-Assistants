In the first part (12.11), we'll preprocess our data for further retrieval. Next day (13.11), we will complete the RAG chatbot and use the data we have preprocessed in the first part to inject our custom knowledge to the LLM. \n",

Some of the sources are also marked with a popcornemoji \\n: that is misc material you might want to take a look at: blog posts, GitHub repos, leaderboardsetc. (also a couple of LLM-based games). For each of the sources, I also leave my subjectiveestimation of how important this work is for this specific topic: from yellow \\n ‘partially useful’ thoughorange \\n ‘useful’ to red \\n ‘crucial findings / thoughts’.

For the pinned papers, I also specify the pages span for you to focus on the most important fragments. Some of the sources are also marked with a popcorn emoji : that is misc material you might want to take a look at: blog posts, GitHub repos, leaderboards etc. (also a couple of LLM-based games). For each of the sources, I also leave my subjective estimation of how important this work is for this specific topic: from yellow 'partially useful' though orange 'useful' to red ' crucial findings / thoughts ' .

    "### Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "During RAG, relevant documents are usually retrieved by semantic similarity that is calculated between the search query and each document in the index. However, if we calculate vectors for the entire PDF pages, we risk not to capture any meaning in the embedding because the context is just too long. That is why usually, loaded text is _chunked_ in a RAG application; embeddings for smaller pieces of text are more discriminative, and thus the relevant context may be retrieved more reliably. Furthermore, it ensure process consistency when working documents of varying sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different approaches to chunking are described in tutorial [Text splitters](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/index#text-splitters) from LangChain. Even though Docling returned a MD document, we won't be using the dedicated [`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/markdown_header_metadata_splitter); instead, for a more general picture, we choose the [`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/recursive_text_splitter) -- a good option in terms of simplicity-quality ratio for simple cases. This splitter tries to keep text structures (paragraphs, sentences) together and thus maintain text coherence in chunks."

The key idea is simple: in a `ChatPromptTemplate`, you write all the static fragments in plain text and then use placeholders to mark the places where some variable parts will be added.

Nach den aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen gibt es acht Planeten in unserem Sonnensystem: Merkur, Venus, Erde, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus und Neptun. (Gute Bewertung: 10/10, da dies eine fest etablierte und allgemein anerkannte Tatsache ist.)\n",

In diesem Fall bleibt die Einheit jedoch konstant.)\n",

    "We will combine the skills we have obtained so far to build a LangGraph agent that receives an input, checks if the user wants to quit, then do the retrieval and generate a context-aware response if not. We will build on the basic version of our first chatbot; to add the RAG functionality, we need to add a retrieval node and modify the generation prompt to inject the retrieved documents.\n",

    "LangGraph provides a pre-built tool to conveniently create a retriever tool. The retriever tool can be connected to the LLM; in this case, the LLM decides itself whether to use it or not. Since we are at the basic RAG yet, we separate the tool from the LLM and handle all use cases uniformly. We also won't generate queries for the retriever for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the lab though, we will connect the LLM and the tool and enhance the procedure of generation."

However, you are strongly encouraged to read references marked by pin emojis : those are comprehensive overviews on the topics or important works that are beneficial for a better understanding of the key concepts. For the pinned papers, I also specify the pages span for you to focus on the most important fragments. Some of the sources are also marked with a popcorn emoji : that is misc material you might want to take a look at: blog posts, GitHub repos, leaderboards etc. (also a couple of LLM-based games). For each of the sources, I also leave my subjective estimation of how important this work is for this specific topic: from yellow 'partially useful' though orange 'useful' to red ' crucial findings / thoughts ' . These estimations will be continuously updated as I revise the materials.\n",

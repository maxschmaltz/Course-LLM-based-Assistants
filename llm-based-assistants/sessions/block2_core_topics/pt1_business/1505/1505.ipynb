    "1. The input receival node. It prompted the user for the input and stored it in the messages for further interaction with the LLM.\n",

To update the state, the function should return a `dict` with the keys corresponding to the state keys, with the **updated** values. The update behavior depends on how you defined your state class (will be rewritten by default or processed by a function if given in `Annotated`)."

    "\n",
    "During RAG, relevant documents are usually retrieved by semantic similarity that is calculated between the search query and each document in the index. However, if we calculate vectors for the entire PDF pages, we risk not to capture any meaning in the embedding because the context is just too long. That is why usually, loaded text is _chunked_ in a RAG application; embeddings for smaller pieces of text are more discriminative, and thus the relevant context may be retrieved better. Furthermore, it ensure process consistency when working documents of varying sizes, and is just more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different approaches to chunking are described in tutorial [Text splitters](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/) from LangChain. We'll use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` -- a good option in terms of simplicity-quality ratio for simple cases. This splitter tries to keep text structures (paragraphs, sentences) together and thus maintain text coherence in chunks."

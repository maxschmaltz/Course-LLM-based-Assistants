    "<h2 id=\"langgraph\">3. Switching to LangGraph 🕸️</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) is a powerful framework for building LLM-based applications in a graph-based manner. It extends LangChain by introducing graph-based workflows where each node can represent an agent, a tool, or a decision point. With support for branching logic, memory, backtracking, and more, LangGraph makes it easier to manage complex interactions and long-running processes. It’s especially useful for developers creating LLM-based multi-agent systems that need to reason, plan, or collaborate (both with and without human interaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are not building a complex system yet, there are a few reasons to switch to LangGraph already:\n",
    "1. Easier data transfer. LangGraph comes with a builtin mechanism for managing messages, properties, metadata etc. -- in one word, _state_ of the system. For example, we will not have to add the messages to the history manually.\n",
    "2. Persistence. LangGraph creates local snapshots of the system state, which allows it to pick up where it left off **between** the interactions.\n",
    "3. Graph structure. We can already use the graph fashion LangGraph provides to easily manage the workflow. We won't be using the stupid `while` loop anymore!\n",
    "4. Scalability and modularity. Even though our chatbot is basic yet, later we will expand it and build other complex pipelines, which LangGraph is just perfect for. Thus, if we build the chatbot with LangGraph now, we will be able to improve and scale it much much easier just **connecting** the necessary logic."

LangGraph builds pipelines as _state machines_, where at each given moment of the time, the system is at a certain _node_, has a certain _state_, and makes a _transition_ based on the defined _edges_. As any state machine, a LangGraph pipeline has a _start node_, _intermediate nodes_, and an _end node_. When you pass the input to the system, it comes from the start node through the intermediate nodes to the end node, after which the system exits. At any transition, LangGraph transfers the state between the nodes. The state contains all the information you configured it to store: messages, properties etc. **Each node receives the current state and returns the updated state**. Thus, the system is always aware of what the current situation is."

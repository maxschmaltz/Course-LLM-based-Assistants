You have two options:

1. If the code is correct and meets the requirements, you should save the codes \
into respective files -- you have a write file tool for that. \
Come up with a name for the website based on the specification, \
and save the HTML code into the folder with this website name in a file named `index.html`, \
and the CSS and JS codes into the same folder but into files that the HTML code expects \
(there are links in the HTML code). If the code is correct and meets the requirements, \
you should NECESSARILY return tool calls to write the files.

2. Otherwise, if the code is not correct or does not meet the requirements, \
you should determine what is wrong with which code, \
and provide feedback to the respective agent -- what should be changed \
so that they can refine their code. Don't forget to explicitly say for which agent the feedback is for. \
Only target one code at a time. This option results in no tool call but in a text response.

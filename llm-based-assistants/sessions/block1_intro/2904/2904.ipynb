    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) is a powerful framework for **building** and **orchestration** of LLM-driven applications. It enables you to chain together language models, tools, and logic into flexible pipelines while maintaining the high level of abstraction. In other words, LangChain manages most of the engineering stuff for you so you can build LLM-based applications seamlessly.\n",

This enables piping components for different purposes easily and intuitively."

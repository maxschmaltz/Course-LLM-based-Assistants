    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) is a powerful framework for **building** and **orchestration** of LLM-driven applications. It enables you to chain together language models, tools, and logic into flexible pipelines while maintaining the high level of abstraction. In other words, LangChain manages most of the engineering stuff for you so you can build LLM-based applications seamlessly.\n",

    "\n",
    "A `Runnable` is the foundational building block in LangChain. It is an abstraction for anything that can be _invoked_ — meaning you can call it with an input and get an output. `Runnable`s share the same interface for the core functionality for you to be able to unify usage of components of different types under the same logic: **input in - output out**. This enables piping components for different purposes easily and intuitively."

    "2. Open the terminal. If you are a Windows user, open GitBash (will be available after Git installation) and not the default cmd.\n",
    "3. Create a Python virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)."

We had assembled a vast host, with estimates ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 men-at-arms, knights, and men of the common sort.\n",

Our French knights, weighed down by our armor and hindered by the muddy terrain, charged valiantly, but were cut down by the hail of arrows and the English defensive line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle raged on for hours, with our knights and men-at-arms making repeated charges, only to be repelled by the English. The mud and the stakes proved to be our undoing, as our horses became mired and our men were unable to breach the English lines.\n",

# LLM-based Assistants
Webbook for the course LLM-based Assistants @ Uni Tübingen (SoSe25)

## Summary

When they were first introduced, LLMs were mainly seen as seq2seq models exclusively for text generation: input text in — output text out. However, as LLMs evolved, their application domain quickly expanded, and they are now used for purposes few could have imagined: from powering websites and automating business processes to drug discovery. The central goals of this course are:

1) to provide a comprehensive overview of how the LLMs are used in the real world;
2) to teach you the basics of implementing LLM-based pipelines for various purposes.

While the course will mostly focus on the practical uses of LLMs, it will also briefly touch on ethical, societal, and broader considerations.

# Topics Overview

The schedule is preliminary and subject to changes!

The reading for each _lecture_ is given as references to the sources the respective lectures base on. You are **not** obliged to read anything. However, you are strongly **encouraged** to read references marked by pin emojis üìå: those are comprehensive overviews on the topics or important works that are beneficial for a better understanding of the key concepts. For the pinned papers, I also specify the pages span for you to focus on the most important fragments. Some of the sources are also marked with a popcorn emoji üçø: that is misc material you might want to take a look at: blog posts, GitHub repos, leaderboards etc. (also a couple of LLM-based games). For each of the sources, I also leave my **subjective** estimation of how important this work is for **this specific** topic: from yellow üü° _'partially useful'_ though orange üü† _'useful'_ to red üî¥ '_crucial findings / thoughts_'. These estimations will be continuously updated as I revise the materials.

For the _labs_, you are provided with practical tutorials that respective lab tasks will mostly derive from. The core tutorials are marked with a writing emoji ‚úçÔ∏è; you are **asked** to inspect them **in advance** (better yet: try them out). On lab sessions, we will only **briefly recap** them so it is up to you to prepare in advance to keep up with the lab.

_Disclaimer_: the reading entries are no proper citations; the bibtex references as well as detailed infos about the authors, publish date etc. can be found under the entry links.

## Block 3: Wrap-up


<a name="1007"></a>
#### 10.07. _Pitch_: RAG Chatbot
> On material of [session 06.05](#0605) and [session 13.05](#1305)

The first pitch will be dedicated to a custom RAG chatbot that the _contractors_ (the presenting students, see the [infos about Pitches](./Formats/Pitches.md)) will have prepared to present. The RAG chatbot will have to be able to retrieve specific information from the given documents (not from the general knowledge!) and use it in its responses.

**Reading**: see [session 06.05](#0605), [session 08.05](#0805), [session 13.05](#1305), [session 15.05](#1505), and [session 20.05](#2005)

<a name="1507"></a>
#### 15.07. _Pitch_: Handling Customer Requests in a Multi-agent Environment
> On material of [session 22.05](#2205)

In the second pitch, the _contractors_ will present their solution to automated handling of customer requests. The solution will have to introduce a multi-agent environment to take off working load from an imaginary support team. The solution will have to read and categorize tickets, generate replies and (in case of need) notify the human that their interference is required.

#### 17.07. _Pitch_: Agent for Web Resumes
> On material of [session 03.06](#0306)

The _contractors_ will present their agent that will have to make up a character biography by the input prompt and generate a minimalistic HTML resume for them by a prompt. For each resume, the agent will also have to generate its own style.

<a name="2207"></a>
#### 22.07. _Pitch_: LLM-based Research Assistant
> On material of [session 01.07](#0107)

The last pitch will introduce an agent that will have to plan the research, generate hypotheses, find the literature etc. for a given scientific problem. It will then have to introduce its results in form of a TODO or a guide for the researcher to start off of. Specific requirements will be released on 03.07.

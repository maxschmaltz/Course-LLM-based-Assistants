Some of the sources are also marked with a popcornemoji \\n: that is misc material you might want to take a look at: blog posts, GitHub repos, leaderboardsetc. (also a couple of LLM-based games).

    "\n",
    "During RAG, relevant documents are usually retrieved by semantic similarity that is calculated between the search query and each document in the index. However, if we calculate vectors for the entire PDF pages, we risk not to capture any meaning in the embedding because the context is just too long. That is why usually, loaded text is _chunked_ in a RAG application; embeddings for smaller pieces of text are more discriminative, and thus the relevant context may be retrieved better. Furthermore, it ensure process consistency when working documents of varying sizes, and is just more computationally efficient.\n",

We'll use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` -- a good option in terms of simplicity-quality ratio for simple cases. This splitter tries to keep text structures (paragraphs, sentences) together and thus maintain text coherence in chunks."

    "As discussed, the retrieval usually succeeds by vector similarity and the index contains not the actual texts but their vector representations. Vector representations are created by _embedding models_ -- models usually made specifically for this objective by being trained to create more similar vectors for more similar sentences and to push apart dissimilar sentences in the vector space.\n",

    "In the last session, we used the [`nv-embedqa-e5-v5`](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5?snippet_tab=LangChain) model -- a model from NVIDIA pretrained for English QA. However, their didn't work very stable, so in this session, we'll substitute them with [HF Sentence Transformers Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers): an open-source lightweight alternative that runs **locally**. However, the choice of the model here also heavily depends on the use case; for example, the model we will be using -- [`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) -- truncates input text longer than 256 word pieces by default, which is fine for our short passages but may be critical in other applications."

      "3. **Reading Materials**: There are several reading materials available on RAG, including:\n",
      "\t* \"Retrieval Augmented Generation or Long-Context LLMs? A Comprehensive Study and Hybrid Approach\" by Google DeepMind & University of Michigan (pages 1-7)\n",
      "\t* \"A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language Models\" by York University (sections 1-7)\n",
      "\t* \"Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks\" by National Chengchi University & Academia Sinica\n",
      "4. **Types of RAG**: There are different types of RAG, including:\n",
      "\t* Agentic RAG\n",
      "\t* Adaptive RAG\n",
      "\t* Auto-RAG\n",
      "\t* Self-RAG\n",
      "5. **Tools and Resources**: LangChain provides various tools and resources for RAG, including text splitters, embedding models, vector stores, retrievers, and prompt templates.\n",
      "6. **Lecture and Pitch**: There will be a lecture on May 13th about Virtual Assistants Pt. 2: RAG, which will expand the scope of chatbot functionality and teach it to refer to a custom knowledge base. The pitch on June 17th will be dedicated to a custom RAG chatbot.\n",

Your competition Submissions must conform to the requirements stated on the Competition Website. Your Submissions will be scored based on the evaluation metric described on the Competition Website. Subject to compliance with the Competition Rules, Prizes, if any, will be awarded to Participants with the best scores, based on the merits of the data science models submitted. See below for the complete Competition Rules. For Competitions designated as hackathons by the Competition Sponsor (“Hackathons”), your Submissions will be judged by the Competition Sponsor based on the evaluation rubric set forth on the Competition Website (“Evaluation Rubric”). The Prizes, if any, will be awarded to Participants with the highest ranking(s) as determined by the Competition Sponsor based on such rubric.</p>
<p>You cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot enter or submit from multiple accounts.</p>

You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.</p>
</section>
<section id="winner-license">
<h3>5. WINNER LICENSE<a class="headerlink" href="#winner-license" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:</p>
<p>Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under CC0, an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org">www.opensource.org</a>) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.</p>
<p>For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding Section for that software.</p>
<p>In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source license in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).</p>
<p>b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.</p>
</section>
<section id="external-data-and-tools">
<h3>6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS<a class="headerlink" href="#external-data-and-tools" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).</p>
<p>b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):</p>
<p>Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the “excessive” costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.</p>
<p>By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.</p>
<p>c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)</p>
<p>Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.</p>
</section>
<section id="eligibility">
<h3>7. ELIGIBILITY<a class="headerlink" href="#eligibility" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. In addition, judges and advertising agencies of the Competition Entities are not eligible to win any Prizes, as well as immediate family (spouse, parents, siblings, and children) and household members of the Competition Sponsor. “Competition Entities” means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates.

<section id="winners-obligations">
<h3>8. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS<a class="headerlink" href="#winners-obligations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:</p>
<p>Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model’s software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. For Hackathons, the Submission deliverables will be as described on the Competition Website, which may be information or materials that are not software code.
a. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).”</p>
<p>b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,</p>
<p>Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;</p>
<p>Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).</p>
